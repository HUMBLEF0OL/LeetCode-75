* Create an integer variable n which stores the number of cities.
* Create a visit array of length n to keep track of nodes that have been visited.
* Create an integer numberOfComponents which stores the number of connected components in the graph. Initialize it to 0.
* Iterate through all of the nodes, and for each node i check if it has been visited or not. If node i is not visited, we increment numberOfComponents by 1 and start a DFS traversal:
* We use the dfs function to perform the traversal. For each call, pass node, isConnected, and visit as the parameters. We start with node i.
* We mark node as visited.
* We iterate over all the values in isConnected[node] to get the neighbors of node. If isConnected[node][i] == 1, one neighbor of node is i (as we have a direct edge between node and i). For each neighbor i that has not yet been visited, we recursively call dfs with i as the node.
* Return numberOfComponents.
